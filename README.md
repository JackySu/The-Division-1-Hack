# The-Division-1-Hack
This GitHub repository exists to expose Ubisoft's incompetence

showcasing the corruption and prevailing bureaucracy within the management levels of this large company.

Once known for delivering countless outstanding works and famous IPs, 

this creative company has now completely succumbed to $$$. 

It serves as the epitaph for "The Division", a game that was once filled with great expectations and boundless potential.

# Credentials

# Known issues
The code is shit I know I didn't intend to publish this repo in the first place, but wake the fuck up Samurai we have a city to burn.
